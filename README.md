Echoes of Silence is a data visualization project developed for the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025. It identifies and visualizes Earth's "radio-quiet" regions—areas with minimal electromagnetic and atmospheric interference—using NASA's open environmental datasets. The goal of the project is to support deep-space communication, satellite calibration, and radio astronomy by pinpointing the most interference-free zones on Earth.

Modern communication networks and expanding urban environments generate increasing electromagnetic noise, which disrupts NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) and global observation systems. This project bridges Earth-science data and space-communication analysis to locate the purest, most stable areas of the planet for high-precision signal work. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Globe.gl, the project renders an interactive 3D globe that demonstrates NASA data visually and dynamically.

The visualization integrates datasets from SMAP, VIIRS, SOHO, and AIA missions to highlight regions of low interference based on atmospheric density, light-pollution levels, and radio-frequency data. Through a step-by-step guided demo, the system shows how these datasets converge to reveal potential "echo-free" zones critical for future satellite and telescope positioning.

Echoes of Silence demonstrates how NASA’s open data can be transformed into actionable insights and educational storytelling. It contributes to the protection of quiet regions essential for communication between Earth and deep-space probes, ensuring that silence itself remains a valuable scientific resource.
